# Very Old Projects
All the code that exists in this repository is from way back when (2020 and earlier) when I used to resell sneakers.
Almost everything in here is a bot, or a script that helped me buy limited shoes across different websites like Nike and any Shopify Site.
There are also tools in here that farmed Gmail accounts, (what do i mean by that), farming a gmail account was the process of faking human like activity on a gmail account in efforts to increase that accounts score to give you easier to solve captchas. The code in here was proven to work at some point and would take a gmail from a score of .3 (really bad) to .9 (the best) in about a week. Having easier captchas when "botting" would save you lots of time when botting and would make it a lot easier to get the limited shoe or item that you wanted.
